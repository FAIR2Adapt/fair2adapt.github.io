# FAIR2Adapt Project Code of Conduct

The FAIR2Adapt project is dedicated to fostering a welcoming, inclusive, and professional environment for all participants. We expect everyone involved to treat others with respect and courtesy, regardless of background or identity.

## Expected Behavior:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Be respectful of diverse viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accept constructive feedback.
- Focus on the collective success of the project.
- Show courtesy and professionalism in all interactions.

## Unacceptable Behavior:
Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Discrimination or harassment based on personal characteristics.
- Intimidation, stalking, or threats of violence.
- Insults, put-downs, or exclusionary jokes.
- Sustained disruption of meetings or communications.
- Unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact.
- Publishing private communication without consent.

## Reporting Violations
If you witness or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. Contact the FAIR2Adapt Project Coordinator (designated Code of Conduct Officer).
2. Submit a detailed report, including:
   - Date and time of the incident.
   - Description of the behavior or action.
   - Names of individuals involved, if known.

Reports will be treated with confidentiality and handled promptly.

## Incident Response and Record Keeping

- **Investigation**: a Code of Conduct Committee will be formed and composed of at least 3 members from 3 different partners. This Committee will assess the report and determine the appropriate action.
- **Recording**: Violations will be documented in a secure, restricted-access repository managed by the project coordinator. Information recorded will include the report date, a factual description of the incident, and actions taken.
- **Privacy**: Access to violation records is restricted to authorized personnel to ensure confidentiality and compliance with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).
- **Retention**: Records will be retained for the duration of the project and securely deleted thereafter.

## Consequences of Violations

Participants asked to stop unacceptable behavior must comply immediately. Violators may face:

- A formal warning.
- Removal from specific project activities, meetings, or platforms.
- In severe cases, removal from the consortium or reporting to relevant authorities.

## Commitment to Resolution
FAIR2Adapt strives to ensure a safe, productive environment for all. By adhering to this Code of Conduct, participants help uphold the values of collaboration, respect, and inclusion essential to our shared success.
